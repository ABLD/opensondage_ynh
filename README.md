OpenSondage for YunoHost

OpenSondage is used to poll people invite for a meeting.

It's a custom version between https://github.com/framasoft/OpenSondage and https://github.com/leblanc-simon/OpenSondage . Indeed, the version from framasoft contains legal mention about framasoft, but is more advanced.
